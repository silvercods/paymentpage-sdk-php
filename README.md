# SapiHost PHP SDK

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/sapihost/paymentpage-sdk-php.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/sapihost/paymentpage-sdk-php)

This is a set of libraries in the PHP language to ease integration of your service
with the SapiHost Payment Page.

Please note that for correct SDK operating you must have at least PHP 7.0.  

## Payment flow

## Installation

Install with composer
```bash
composer require sapihost/paymentpage-sdk
```

### Get URL for payment

```php
$gate = new sapihost\Gate('secret');
$payment = new sapihost\Payment('11', 'some payment id');
$payment->setPaymentAmount(1000)->setPaymentCurrency('RUB');
$url = $gate->getPurchasePaymentPageUrl($payment);
``` 

`$url` here is the signed URL.

If you want to use another domain for URL you can change it with optional `Gate` constructor parameter:
```php
new sapihost\Gate('secret', 'https://mydomain.com/payment');
```
or change it with method 
```php
$gate->setPaymentBaseUrl('https://mydomain.com/payment');
```

### Handle callback from SapiHost

You'll need to autoload this code in order to handle notifications:

```php
$gate = new sapihost\Gate('secret');
$callback = $gate->handleCallback($data);
```

`$data` is the JSON data received from payment system;

`$callback` is the Callback object describing properties received from payment system;
`$callback` implements these methods: 
1. `Callback::getPaymentStatus();`
    Get payment status.
2. `Callback::getPayment();`
    Get all payment data.
3. `Callback::getPaymentId();`
    Get payment ID in your system.
